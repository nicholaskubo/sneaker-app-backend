MJ’s signature is scrawled across the lateral heel, while a dual-branded patch adorns the sockliner. The sneaker’s tooling pairs a vintage off-white midsole with an icy translucent rubber outsole."

When Peter Moore designed the first Air Jordan in 1985, he wanted to provide support for the dynamic superstar with the freakishly athletic game—without sacrificing comfort. He designed a high-top shoe with durable leather featuring upper eyelet straps, heel and midfoot overlays, and a perforated toebox. The history of flight had begun."

The colorway is inspired by a similar AJ1 that dropped in 2001: a Mid-Top version and a Japan-exclusive High-Top version. This &#39;Midnight Navy&#39; tribute—debuted in June 2019—reworks the icon with suede paneling and Metallic Silver Swooshes. A bright Jumpman logo on the toe box is a nice subtle detail, along with the Zoom Air sockliner for impact protection."

        "story":"In concert with a white model, the Air Jordan 1 Retro High &#39;All Star - Black&#39; 2019 pays homage to a couple special events with a 300-pair limited run. The sneaker was made available February 17th, 2019—Jordan&#39;s 56th birthday—to mark the NBA All-Star game being played in Charlotte. Imagined by the Jumpman himself, this version of Tinker Hatfield&#39;s 1985 classic has a quilted-leather upper and tongue tag from the 1991 game. Proceeds of original sales went to the Charlotte Hornets Foundation."

        "story":"The Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG ‘Turbo Green’ complements the silhouette’s clean lines with a classic two-tone design. A textured white leather base is contrasted by soft suede overlays in Turbo Green. The latter design element is burnished to give off a vintage aesthetic, a quality that’s further enhanced by a midsole finished in Off-White Sail. In addition to a woven Nike Air tongue tag in purple and yellow, exterior branding also includes a line of text at the base of the quarter panel that reads ‘SP 19 Air Jordan 1 High OG.’"
